Create a class called Animal that has a constructor method that takes one argument: species.
It should have a getter for species and a method called makeSound() that logs a sound the animal makes.
Create a subclass called Cat that extends the Animal class. Add a method to the Cat class called purr() that logs "purr" to the console. Create a subclass called Dog that extends the Animal class.
Add a method to the Dog class called bark() that logs "woof" to the console.
//complete this code
class Animal {
	constructor(species) {
    this._species = species;
  }

  get species() {
    return this._species;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log("The " + this.species + " makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	 bark() {
    console.log("woof");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
	 purr() {
    console.log("purr");
  }
}

// Do not change the code below this line
window.Animal = Animal;
window.Dog = Dog;
window.Cat = Cat;
